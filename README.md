# MonkeyTestingiOS

About
-----
MonkeyTestingiOS is a stress testing script written using xcuitest & compatible with latest xcode versions. This tool is an rewritten version of [ui-auto-monkey](https://github.com/jonathanpenn/ui-auto-monkey).

Since latest versions of xcode donot support UIAutomation on which ui-auto-monkey mainly works on, MonkeyTestingiOS tool comes to your rescue.

Supports versions of xcode7+. 
Easy to use in CI.

Contributing to MonkeyTestingiOS
---------------------
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
